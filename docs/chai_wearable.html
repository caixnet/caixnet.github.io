            <li>Wearable devices require simply and unified gesture coding for handling the complicated input and output. What would be the idea selection for encoding? It is suitable for human to grasp and at the same time easy for machines to recognize and process with low error rate.</li>
            <li>When communicating, language and symbols are the most important tools to facilitate the interaction with each other and to pass down culture and thoughts through generations</li>
            <li>Using one figure via one stroke to input the Chai symbols and it is processed to the respective localization characters, including alphabets, numbers, punctuations and control symbols. </li>
            <li>Chai shift control symbols (|) is applied together with Chai alphabets and Chai numbers to generate the uppercase letters and punctuations. </li>
            <li>When implementing Chai encoding in flat surface, tap the input box first; four endpoints appears in the screen. Four endpoints and two diagonals generate the four point shaped auxiliary frame. Users can use the auxiliary frame to motion input using Chai gesture symbols. When implementing Chai encoding in touch pad, four raised dots are designed in the touch pad. Users will use the four dots to facilitate to motion the Chai gesture symbols. </li>
            <li>The uniqueness of Chai symbols makes it possible to motion Chai symbols on virtual screen in the air. User can use gesture recognition technology to remote control TV’s or other devices. Index finger is normally to motion the input and in certain conditions index finger and thumb can be used together to facilitate input and control the remote devices. </li>
            <li>Chai symbol language is one of the line symbolic languages. Comparing to the other natural languages, Chai is a geometrical symbolic system which is more mathematic oriented. It is a simplified and geometric figure evolution of natural language symbols. Comparing to the typical dot symbolic language braille which is a binary encoding system, but Chai is a ternary encoding system. And Chai is also easier to learn and input comparing to Braille. A portable coin sized Chai keyboard with 3 or 4 touch endpoints can be designed. It can be used to replace the traditional 101 QWERT keyboard keys.</li>
            <li>Chai can be used as a wearable device gesture language, with the flat surface input and 3D input to facilitate the information exchange. With the 4 endpoints routes and unified encoding rules, it is easy to learn and understanding. It can be used in different triacode adaptable devices.</li>
            <li>Chai is a gesture symbol language designed for wearable devices. Chai gesture symbol language is a universal, simple, unified language which is used for man-machine interaction and is also easy to learn. Features of Chai make it an ideal solution for both PC and wearable devices. Furthermore, wearable devices are where Chai can show its advantage and promised future.</li>
